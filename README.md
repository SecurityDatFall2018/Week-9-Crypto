## What to Install

[WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) If you consider yourself a green student you kan skip this step. I will however use it for a class demo, so if you wan't to follow on, it must be installed, otherwise you can just watch. Wee will also use wireshark in a future lesson.
