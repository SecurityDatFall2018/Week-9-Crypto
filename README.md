# Week-9-Crypto
Cryptograhy, Certificates, Digital Signatures, Man-in-the-middle and more

_This is going to be a pretty heavy week when it comes to theory. Most of the exercises will not involve coding, but steps necessary to understand and USE the terms below, and see how they are all required to get a secure connection in a browser_
- Symmetric Encryption
- Asymmetric Encryption
- Hashing and Hash Digests
- MAC (Message Authentication Code)
- Digital Signatures
- Certificates
- Certificate Authorities and Certificate Trust Hierarchies
- Cipher Suites

## What to Install

[WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) If you consider yourself a green student you kan skip this step. I will however use it for a class demo, so if you wan't to follow on, it must be installed, otherwise you can just watch. Wee will also use wireshark in a future lesson.

If you just can wait to get started ;-) this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ht-E-Kihk) more or less do, what I plan for us to do together in the class
## What to Read/Watch

#### Watch
- [Introduction to Cryptographic Keys and Certificates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9vu6_2r0o4)
- [What are certificates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRMBZhdFjDI&t=264s) (Covers more or less the same topics as the next video, I do however recomment both)
- [What is PIK (public key infrastructure)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OqgYSXWYQM&t=170s) (watch the first 8 minutes)
- [Intro to SSH and SSH Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF6J-VQHPxA&t=293s) (This introduces the three scenaious you are expected to set up in the first exercise, and eventually demonstrate at the exam)

#### Read

- [Man in the middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) Read the first part (Example) of the article and skim the rest
- [Symmetric vs Asymetric Encryption](https://www.jscape.com/blog/bid/84422/Symmetric-vs-Asymmetric-Encryption)
- [Cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) (Skim only)
- [Cipher Suites](https://www.jscape.com/blog/cipher-suites) Skim only, neccesary to understand parts of the Wireshark demo
- [Differenc between a digital signature, a MAC and a hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) Read the approved answer in this StackExchange article

## Exercises
- [SSL and SSH, three different scenarious](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ac7HrNnu4rlS43LODodjAP25KR-p2apKSaMFy01PWro/edit?usp=sharing) This shoul preferably be done/started before lesson-1 in this week
- [Smaller demoes](#) TBD
